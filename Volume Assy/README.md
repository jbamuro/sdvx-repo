## Konami Volume Assembly

![Image of Konami Volume Assembly](Images/Volume_Assy.png)

This is a full model of the Volume Assembly from a Sound Voltex Nemsys machine.

I've swapped the hardware and bushings out for items from McMaster, but part numbers for the official hardware can be found on the [GameRepair.info](https://gamerepair.info/parts/79_sound_voltex_volume_assembly) page.

Unfortunately, the small washer does not have a direct McMaster equivalent. I would probably use [this washer](https://www.mcmaster.com/91545A450/) with a few layers of scotch tape to shim the missing height.


In this fork I am modifying the readme to cater to someone who is trying to make 2 volume assemblies from scratch, if you for example, purchased an arcade panel that did not come with any.

As mentioned above in the original text, the STEP includes parts needed etc but I want to simplify it for people who don't use CAD software etc.

I've added a new .STEP that includes just the 4 parts that are not purchasable ( 1, 3, 5, 8 in the gamerepair doc). Remember to print 2 sets of them.

Worried that the STEP measurements for some of the parts aren't the same to the arcade.......for example the bushings bottom bushing should be 5mm long but this guy says 3mm long

    Spaces the knob from the bracket so it doesn't rub, also acts as a tension fit component to keep the top bushing in place. Commonly misplaced when removing the knob.
